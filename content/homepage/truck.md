### 2008 Ford F-250 Lariat

The truck is a 2008 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel with the [factory camper package](https://www.rvandplaya.com/camper-package-on-ford-f250/) from the factory. It has a 6 and 3/4 foot long bed and the Lariat trim package. The exterior and interior are in great shape and as of May 2022 it has almost 105,000 miles on it and has driven like a champion for us on and off road.

Before we bought it, it spent all of it's life in New Mexico with low annual miles and we have carefully serviced it since we purchased it. The CARFAX [report is available here](/sauntering-snail/pdf/CARFAX_Vehicle_History_Report_for_2008_FORD_F250_SUPER_DUTY_1FTSX21R58EB19660.pdf) and we have a more complete maintenance record that we can share if you'd like to see it. We have had excellent reviews every time we have it serviced and and would expect this engine to last for many more hundreds of thousands of miles.

We bought this truck because we wanted an extremely dependable and off-road capable truck that could easily haul our tiny home. While we didn't tackle the absolutely most challenging 4x4 paths, we spent a lot of time off pavement and the truck met every challenge easily whether it was steep climbs, loose sand, thick mud, snow and ice, or bare rock. We always felt like we had power and payload to spare, which is a good feeling when you're dozens of miles from cell service and pavement.

We also wanted a vehicle size that would be highly manueverable and at 21ft long and only 9ft high we were able to get into a lot of tight spots where bigger rigs had no chance. We often camped with no one in sight, but if any other campers were in the vicinity they were usually tent campers in small 4x4 vehicles.

It currently has the highly regarded [Cooper Discoverer LT275/70R18](https://www.tireshot.com/tire/Cooper-Discoverer-ATP-275-70R18-125-122S-OWL-tire), but these are near the end of their life and you'll want to buy new tires before setting off on any longer trips.

Heavy duty used trucks are hard to find right now, and this generation of F-250 (the 2008-2010 generation) with a Powerstroke engine, Lariat trim package, 4x4, and less than 150,000 miles are currently [listed between $26k to $40k at dealerships](https://www.cars.com/shopping/results/?dealer_id=&drivetrain_slugs[]=four_wheel_drive&fuel_slugs[]=diesel&keyword=&list_price_max=&list_price_min=&makes[]=ford&maximum_distance=all&mileage_max=150000&models[]=ford-f_250&page_size=20&sort=best_match_desc&stock_type=used&trims[]=ford-f_250-lariat&year_max=2010&year_min=2008&zip=46256).
