### 2008 Ford F-250 Lariat

The truck is a 2008 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel which came with the camper package (heavier duty leaf springs) from the factory. It has a 6 and 3/4 foot long bed and the Lariat trim package. There are a few minor scratches and dents, but overall the exterior and interior are in great shape. As of May 2022 it has 105,000 miles on it and has driven like a champion for us on and off road over 30,000 miles.

While this model year of the Ford Powerstroke Diesel is not as highly regarded as other years, we have had great results and excellent reviews every time we have it serviced. Before we bought it it spent all of it's life in New Mexico with low annual miles and we have carefully serviced it since we purchased it. The car fax report is available here. It currently has the highly regarded NAME of TIRES, but they will should probably be replaced in the next 10,000 miles.
