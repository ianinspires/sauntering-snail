We are selling our Palomino camper and Ford F-250 along with all of the upgrades and improvements we have made over a year and half of exploring the U.S. and Mexico. We also have a lot of other useful gear that can be part of the sale including an inflatable kayak, a DJI Mavic drone, two tire air compressors, an extra diesel can, 3 extra water cans , a well equipped kitchen, linens, and more. We lived out of the camper for a year and our next adventure is to backpack and work remotely for a few years abroad, so we'd like to sell the truck and camper to someone who is looking for the same things we were when we assembled everything. A year ago we wrote a [post detailing our thoughts on the camper](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/review-of-the-palomino-ss-1200-pop-up-truck-camper/) on truckcamperadventure.com. The truck and camper are currently in Indianapolis, but we're open to sales in a large geographic area.

Contact us if you're interested and we can schedule a video tour.
