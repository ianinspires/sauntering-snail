We are selling our Palomino camper and Ford F-250 along with all of the upgrades and improvements we have made over a year and half of exploring the U.S. and Mexico. We will optionally throw in extra equipment we found useful for our travels including two tire air compressors, extra diesel tanks, extra water tanks, a drone, an inflatable kayak, a fully stocked kitchen, and camping gear. We lived out of the camper for a year and our next adventure is to backpack and work remotely for a few years abroad.
