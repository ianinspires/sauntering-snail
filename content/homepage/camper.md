### 2021 Palomino SS-1200

The camper is a 2021 model year Palomino SS-1200 which we bought new in November 2020. The [factory model from Palomino](https://palominorv.com/truck-campers/backpack-truck-camper/SS-1200/2606) is 12 feet 10 inches long and ours had a dry weight of 1491 pounds. This model in [recent years is currently listing for $17k to $25k](https://www.rvtrader.com/2020-Any-Palomino-Backpack-Edition-Ss-1200-Truck-Camper/rvs-for-sale?type=Truck%20Camper%7C198074&make=Palomino%7C2289282&model=BACKPACK%20EDITION%7C764956346&trim=SS-1200%7C38001&year=2020%3A%2A&sort=year%3Adesc&page=1) without all of the upgrades we have made.

This is a really nice pop up camper and we had a blast living in it. I wrote more about [our assessment of the camper in this blog post](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/review-of-the-palomino-ss-1200-pop-up-truck-camper/) from July 2021.
