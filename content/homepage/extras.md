In addition to the truck and camper the rig is outfitted with extra gear included if you purchase the truck and camper together with our bundled asking price.

- 4 [Torklift Long Grey FastGun Turnbuckles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SSIDUQ) with [FastGun locks](https://www.amazon.com/Torklift-S9500-FastGun-Lock-Set/dp/B002QH0DH0/).
- Two high PSI air compressors for heavy duty tires. We would often air down our high PSI Series E rated tires for rough roads or loose sand and then air them back up when we reached pavement. We added 2 external DC plugs to the camper so we could run both compressors at the same time from the solar panels.
- The excellent [Advanced Elements Inflatable Kayak](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O5VE/) (which fit very nicely in the middle seat of the truck cab) including 2 paddles, a pump, and 2 life jackets.
- A pair of jumper cables.
- A [heavy duty ratchet kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016W351AW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). We never had to use this but it's nice to have when venturing off pavement.
- A [2 pack of 5 gallon water jugs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HQZWH5P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). These slide into the truck sidewall and can be siphoned into the 25 gallon tank if you want to bring extra water for long boondocking stretches.
- An external 5 gallon gray water tank.
- Various hoses that are useful for refilling the water tank, siphoning clean water, or draining gray water into the external tank.
- 5 gallon propane tanks. We found that one tank would often last us for 10-15 days.
- All of the pots, pans, cups, bowls, cutlery, and kitchen equipment that we used while traveling. Our custom built storage fits the things we've selected quite well!
- The [Cleanwaste toilet](https://cleanwaste.com/products/go-anywhere-portable-toilet-the-pett), a shovel, and lots of biodegradable wipes. This setup worked great for us when nature called.
- A small tool set that we used for all of the upgrades while on the road including a drill, an impact driver, a ratchet set, lots of electrical tools and supplies, a handsaw, and more.
- We will share our list of favorite boondocking spots with you. We spent over a year scouting and exploring hundreds of camping spots and navigating the various listing sites. After all of that experience we have a short list of favorite spots (with GPS coordinates) and would be happy to give you advice on the lessons we learned finding excellent boondocking locations.
