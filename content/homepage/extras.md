In addition to the truck and camper we have outfitted the rig with extra gear that we no longer need once we start backing around. We would be happy to include this gear if you purchase the truck and camper together.

- Two high PSI air compressors for heavy duty tires. We would often air down our high PSI Series E rated tires for rough roads or loose sand and then air them back up when we reached pavement. We added 2 external DC plugs to the camper so we could run both compressors at the same time from the solar panels.
- A pair of jumper cables.
- A [heavy duty ratchet kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016W351AW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). We never had to use this but it's nice to have when venturing off pavement.
- A 5 gallon [metal fuel can](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008Y4FSTM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) that fits in the truck sidewall or the cab. We never had to use this but preferred to have have extra just in case when we drove far away from pavement.
- A [2 pack of 5 gallon water jugs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HQZWH5P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). These slide into the truck sidewall and can be siphoned into the 25 gallon tank if you want to bring extra water for long boondocking stretches.
- An external 5 gallon gray water tank.
- Various hoses that are useful for refilling the water tank, siphoning clean water, or draining gray water into the external tank.
- 2 standard 5 gallon propane tanks. We found that one tank would often last us for 10 days but we preferred to always have a full extra tank for long boondocking trips.
- Folding camping table.
- All of the pots, pans, cups, bowls, cutlery, and kitchen equipment that we used while traveling. Our custom built storage fits the things we've selected quite well!
- The [Cleanwaste toilet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TKGAKO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), a shovel, and lots of biodegradable wipes. This setup worked great for us when nature called.
- A small tool set that we used for all of the upgrades while on the road including a drill, an impact driver, a ratchet set, lots of electrical tools and supplies, a handsaw, a caulk gun, and more.
- We will share our list of favorite boondocking spots with you. We spent over a year scouting and exploring hundreds of camping spots and navigating the various listing sites. After all of that experience we have a small list of favorite spots (with GPS coordinates) and would be happy to give you advice on the lessons we learned finding excellent boondocking locations.
